Congratulations! If you are asking this question, you have gotten quite far along the path, have an acceptance in hand and are staring down your bootcamp start date, with excitement and probably a bit of trepidation!

Fear not… you will be ready!

**First, make sure to complete all of the required PreWork assigned to you by the bootcamp**. This is the foundation upon which your bootcamp will begin on day one, and if you haven’t done it, you will be chasing from behind the whole time. Stay out in front of this and complete this as soon as you receive it.

**Second, you may wish to get a few handy tools and skills under your belt.** Set up your environment, download an IDE like Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) , find some information on using Git/Github, and practice using the dev console. Create a github account and profile at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

**Practice your typing!!** You’re going to be typing code all day and the better your skills are, the less likely you are to make coding errors simply by typos. Here’s a resource for that [Typing Practice For Programmers](https://typing.io/)

**And start making connections** on LinkedIn, twitter, and other social media presence because your network will be your greatest asset!

Hope this helps and happy coding!
